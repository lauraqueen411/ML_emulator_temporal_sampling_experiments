## Quick Start

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lauraqueen411/ML_emulator_temporal_sampling_experiments.git
````

**Note:** This repository is *not fully self-contained*. Essential training and inference data are located on the **Maui** system and described below.

---

## Project Structure

This repository is organized into three main components:

1. **Training** â€“ Model training workflows and configurations
2. **Inference** â€“ Emulator application and high-level metric computation
3. **Plotting** â€“ Analysis and figure generation

---

## Python Environment

All training, inference, and plotting scripts call the following python executable:

```bash
/nesi/project/niwa00018/rampaln/envs/ml_env_v2/bin/python
```

A reproducible environment file for the `ml_env_v2` Conda environment **with no builds** is included:

```
environment.yml
```

---

### Jupyter Kernel

All notebooks use the **"jupyter\_env"** kernel:

```
/scale_wlg_persistent/filesets/home/queenle/.local/share/jupyter/kernels/nellys_env/
```

---

## Emulator Training

### Main Training Scripts (/training)

* **submit\_jobs\_{cluster}.sh**
  * Submits Slurm jobs for each emulator
  * Reads config (.json) files from `/emulators/`
* **run\_experiments\_{cluster}.sl**
  * Slurm configuration for Maui or Mahuika clusters
* **train\_model\_temporal\_experiments.py**
  * Main Python training script

---

### Essential Training Files

* **temporal\_samplings\_2.csv**
  * Critical for temporal sampling experiments
  * Defined using:
    ```
    /training/define_temporal_samplings.ipynb
    ```
  * **Important:** Re-run carefully to avoid overwriting the CSV.
  
---

### Training Inputs

* Emulator config `.json` files in:
  ```
  /training/emulators/
  ```
* Predictor, target, and static inputs defined in the configs:
  ```
  /nesi/project/niwa00018/ML_downscaling_CCAM/
  ```

---

### Training Outputs

* Model weights (`.h5`) and periodic images (`.png`) saved to:
  ```
  /emulators/{emulator_name}/
  ```

---

## Emulator Inference

### Main Inference Scripts (/inference)

* **submit\_runs.sh**
  * Submits Slurm jobs for inference
  * Note: must manual edit variables to select GCMs, emulators, ML types (GAN/U-Net) and epoch for inference

* **apply\_emulator\_{cluster}.sl**
  * Slurm configuration for Maui/Mahuika

* **run\_emulator\_temporal\_tests.py**
  * Main inference script

* **compute\_metrics.py**
  * Computes climatological metrics after inference
  * Metrics include annual/seasonal means, rx1d, total max
  * Historical (1985-2004) and future (2080-2099) climatologies computed

---

### Inference Inputs

* Emulator config from:
  ```
  /training/emulators
  ```
* Perfect (coarsened RCM) inputs:
  ```
  /nesi/project/niwa00018/ML_downscaling_CCAM/multi-variate-gan/inputs/predictor_fields/
  ```
* Imperfect (raw GCM) inputs:
  ```
  /nesi/project/niwa03712/CMIP6_data/Downscaled_Preprocessed/
  ```

---

### Inference Outputs (/inference/output/)

* Structure:
  ```
  /{GCM}/{emulator}/
      - NetCDF downscaled simulations
      - Organized by historical/ssp370, perfect/imperfect, GAN/U-Net, epochs

  /metrics/{GCM}/{emulator}/
      - NetCDF metric climatologies
  ```

---

## Plotting (/plotting)

### Figure Notebooks

* Named by manuscript figure numbers:

  ```
  Figure_1_temporal_sampling.ipynb, etc.
  ```
* Each notebook:

  * Produces final figure
  * Generates *all* plots across experiment dimensions (GCMs, epoch, framework)
  * Notebooks without 'Figure' in the title contain code for other exploratory or supplementary plotting.

---

### Plotting Outputs

* Final manuscript figures:
  ```
  /plotting/final_figures
  ```
* All experiment plots:
  ```
  /plotting/plots
  ```

---

### Plotting Metrics Computation (/plotting/compute_metrics)

```
* RMSE image errors are computed in notebooks
* histogram and PSD counts are computed using a bash -> SLURM -> python workflow
* all metric results are saved in the /results directory
